The purpose of this A/B test was to evaluate the impact of two different mobile website landing page design (Design A and Design B) on user engagement metrics for GloBox.

The test was conducted on a sample of 48,943 unique users who visited the website. Users were randomly assigned to either the control group (Design A) or treatment group (Design B) and the unit of diversion was considered to be the user id.

The focus of this experiment was on revenue and conversion which led to choosing ‘average amount spent per user’ and ‘conversion rate’ as the metrics of interest.

A two sample T-test and Z-Test was conducted to compare the average amount spent per user and conversion rate in the control and treatment groups respectively.

Based on the A/B test conducted with a P-value of 0.944 and 95% confidence interval (-0.439, 0.470), we fail to reject the null hypothesis (H0) that there is no statistically significant difference in the average amount spent per user between the control and treatment group.

Also, Based on the A/B test conducted with a P-value of 0.001 and 95% confidence interval (0.0035, 0.0107), we reject the null hypothesis (H0) that there is no significant difference in the conversion rate between the control and treatment group. However, this difference is not practically significant.

It was recommended that the new landing page design should not be launched. Further re-design of the experiment and testing should be performed to establish both a statistical and practical significance before a new landing page design is launched.
